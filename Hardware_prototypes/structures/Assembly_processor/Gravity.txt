(b) Show the location of the regions [+, [-, [0, and 1- of flat spacetime:
    [+] : y = π, ~ = 0
    [-] : y = -π, ~ = 0
    [0] : y = 0, ~ = π
    [1+] : y + ~ ≈ π, with -π < y - ~ < π

(Refer to equations) variables/points

(c) In flat spacetime, on a (y, ~) coordinate diagram (Figure 34.2):
    - Radial null lines make angles of 45° with the vertical axis.
    - Nonradial null lines make angles of less than 45°.

Examples: REISSNER-NORDSTRÖM SPACETIME

Section: Reissner-Nordström Spacetime
(a) Show that a coordinate system exists where the Reissner-Nordström geometry (for 0 < |Q| < M) has the form:
    ds² = F²(–dy² + d~²) + r²(de² + sin²e dep²),
    with r = r(y, ~).


Definitions:

Definition: q > χ or equivalently χ > q
"The event q precedes the event χ" or "the event χ follows the event q"
Meaning: There exists at least one smooth, future-directed timelike curve that extends from q to χ.

Definition: Causal Curve
A causal curve γ(λ) is any smooth curve that is nowhere spacelike; it is timelike or null or "zero" (γ(λ) = some fixed q for all λ) or some admixture thereof.

Definition: q -< χ or equivalently χ >- q
"The event q causally precedes the event χ" or "the event χ causally follows the event q"
Meaning: There exists at least one future-directed causal curve that extends from q to χ.

Definition: J⁻(q)
The causal past of q is the set of all events that causally precede q.
    J⁻(q) = {χ | χ -< q}

Definition: J⁺(q)
The causal future of q is the set of all events that causally follow q.
    J⁺(q) = {χ | χ >- q}


Definition: J⁻(S)
If S is a region of spacetime (e.g., a segment of a spacelike hypersurface), then J⁻(S) is the set of all events that causally precede at least one event in S.
    J⁻(S) = {χ | χ -< q for at least one q ∈ S}

Definition: J⁺(S)
Similarly, J⁺(S) is the set of all events that causally follow at least one event in S.
    J⁺(S) = {χ | χ >- q for at least one q ∈ S}

Definition: ∂J⁺(S)
j⁺(S) is the boundary of J⁺(S).

Definition: ∂J⁻(S)
j⁻(S) is the boundary of J⁻(S).
