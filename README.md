# Vehicle Systems Design

 **Project Overview**  
This project explores advanced vehicle systems using:

- **General Relativity Metrics** (Kruskal-Szekeres, Reissner-NordstrÃ¶m, Schwarzschild)
- **Application Acceleration** with Vitis Unified Software Platform (UG1393)
- **FPGA-Based Video and Sensor Processing** (Spartan-6 and Zynq Ultrascale+)
- **Quantum-Accurate Spatial Layouts** and **Artificial Gravity Concepts**
- **Thermal Protection Materials** inspired by NASA's Parker Solar Probe
- **Real-Time Sensor Fusion and Control** using **Xilinx FPGA Core AI**

ðŸš€ **Applications and Inspirations**  
- In-cabin IVI/DI/ADAS convergence systems
- APA (Automated Parking Assistance) using scalable sensor solutions
- Solar radiation protection for embedded electronics
- Hydrogen modular vehicle design (Toyota Mirai)
- Solar-powered vehicle architecture (Solar Team Eindhoven Lightyear 0)
