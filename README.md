# Vehicle Systems Design

 **Project Overview**  
This project explores advanced vehicle systems using:

- **General Relativity Metrics** (Kruskal-Szekeres, Reissner-NordstrÃ¶m, Schwarzschild)
- **Application Acceleration** with Vitis Unified Software Platform (UG1393)
- **Thermal Protection Materials** inspired by NASA's Parker Solar Probe

ðŸš€ **Applications and Inspirations**  
- In-cabin IVI/DI/ADAS convergence systems
- Solar radiation protection for embedded electronics
- Solar-powered vehicle architecture (Solar Team Eindhoven Lightyear 0)

ðŸ“š **References**  
- *Introduction to Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion* â€” Francis Chen  
- *High Temperature Materials and Mechanisms* â€” Yoseph Bar-Cohen  

 **Technological Advantages**  
- Rapid adaptation to evolving sensor suites  
- High performance with low-latency DNN solutions  
- Scalable performance and reduced time-to-market  
- Electromagnetic suspension and gravitational field control concepts
