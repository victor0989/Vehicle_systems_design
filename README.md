**Tesla Summary**
üì° Tesla Model S Sensors Overview
Cameras (8 cameras surrounding the vehicle)

-Front Radar (works under all weather conditions)
-Ultrasonic Sensors (12 ultrasonic sensors around the vehicle)
-IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) (accelerometer + gyroscope)
-High-Precision GPS
-Vision Processor and Sensor Fusion Module (Tesla proprietary, AI-based)

Note: Tesla vehicles currently do not use LIDARs (except for experimental phases).
Elon Musk has opted for a combination of cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors instead.

üõ∞Ô∏è Xilinx Sensors for Military Aircraft (Adaptable to Vehicles)
Xilinx provides advanced sensor systems for aerospace and defense, which can be adapted to automotive projects:
-Sensor Fusion FPGA Systems
(integration of radar, lidar, thermal, and infrared sensors)
-High-Speed Data Acquisition Cards
(real-time capture and processing of flight sensor data)
-Radiation-Hardened FPGAs (Virtex-5QV Series)
(chips capable of surviving extreme space and military environments)
-AI/ML Edge Inference on Sensors
(processing data directly on the sensor node without server dependency)
-MEMS-Based Gravimetric Sensors
(miniaturized sensors to measure gravitational changes and accelerations)
