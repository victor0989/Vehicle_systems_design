# Vehicle Systems Design

 **Project Overview**  
Advanced vehicle systems using:

- **General Relativity Metrics**
- Document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT7lilAG8VHA1UtFnDCtDKsYcuJT-Ej5LIt99RAuWhHzD2wsJhuec3JstZ6O1K1Q3OhrGGz9uZXTIzM/pub
- **Application Acceleration** with Vitis Unified Software Platform (UG1393)
- **Thermal Protection Materials** inspired by NASA's Parker Solar Probe
- Sensor Integration: Design the vehicle's sensor suite using Xilinx's programmable logic devices, ensuring compatibility with automotive safety standards (ISO 26262).
- Material Application: Employ Parker Solar Probe-inspired materials in areas exposed to high thermal loads, such as near the reactor core or exhaust systems.
- System Architecture: Develop a centralized processing module that aggregates sensor data, performs real-time analysis, and controls vehicle dynamics.

ðŸš€ **Applications and Inspirations**  
- Solar radiation protection for embedded electronics
- Solar-powered vehicle architecture (Solar Team Eindhoven Lightyear 0)
