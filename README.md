# Vehicle Systems Design

 **Project Overview**  
Advanced vehicle systems using:

- **General Relativity Metrics** 
- **Application Acceleration** with Vitis Unified Software Platform (UG1393)
- **Thermal Protection Materials** inspired by NASA's Parker Solar Probe

ðŸš€ **Applications and Inspirations**  
- Solar radiation protection for embedded electronics
- Solar-powered vehicle architecture (Solar Team Eindhoven Lightyear 0)
