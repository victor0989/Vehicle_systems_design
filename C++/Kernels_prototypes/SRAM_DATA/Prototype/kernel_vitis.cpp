//XRT-Managed Kernels	User-Managed Kernels
//The object class for an XRT-managed kernel is xrt::kernel
//The software application communicates with the XRT-managed kernel using higher-level commands such as set_arg, run, and wait
//The user does not need to know the low-level details of the programmable registers and kernel execution protocols
//Control and status registers provide XRT with a known interface to interact with the kernel, which makes these high-level commands possible
//If needed, it is also possible to control an XRT-managed kernel as a user-managed kernel (using atomic register reads and write)
//OpenCL API can also be used with XRT-managed kernels (cl::kernel)

sing xrt::bo::sync()
Use xrt::bo::sync to sync data from the host to the device with XCL_BO_SYNC_TO_DEVICE flag, or from the device to the host with XCL_BO_SYNC_FROM_DEVICE flag using xrt::bo::write, or xrt::bo::read to write the buffer from the host application, or read the buffer from the device.

bo0.sync(XCL_BO_SYNC_TO_DEVICE);
