Component | Function | Material & Why It Works
Magnetic Cusp Injectors | Funnel warm H–D plasma into the exchange chamber | Nb–Ti superconducting coils: high field at compact size (Chen §2.3)
Porous Graphene-Oxide Catalyst | Catalyze ion–neutral recombination, seed charge exchange | Graphene-oxide: tunable pore size, extreme thermal tolerance (§4.2)
Boron Nitride Nanotube Mesh | Structural support & secondary filtration of macroscopic debris | h-BN nanotubes: wide bandgap, high thermal conductivity, radiation hard (§5.4)
Ionic Liquid Separator | Capture residual neutral atoms, prevent backflow | Ionic liquids (e.g., EMI-BF₄): stable up to 1000 K, chemically inert
Magnetized Heat Exchanger | Remove waste heat via MHD drag, feed to liquid-metal loop | Tungsten mesh with carbon foam backing (Parker-like TPS): reflects radiative heat, spreads conduction (§3.6)
MHD Electrodes | Direct conversion of plasma flow into electricity | Graphite-tungsten composite: low sputter, high melting point
Superconducting Magnetic Pumps | Circulate liquid metal coolant around reactor & filters | YBCO tapes: operate at 77 K (liquid nitrogen) for compact cryo‐systems (§2.7)
