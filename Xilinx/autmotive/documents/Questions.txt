3. Key Interchange Questions
Membrane Porosity vs. Confinement

a) What Debye-length–scaled pore sizes (~10⁻⁵ m) maximize ion–neutral collisions without leaking too much plasma? (Chen §4.3)

b) Sheath Potential Management

c) How to bias the graphene catalyst surface to control sheath thickness (~a few mm) and avoid sputtering? (Chen §5.2)

d) Heat Flux Limits

e) Can the tungsten–carbon foam assembly handle >10 MW/m² without melting? Use radiative and conductive heat transfer models (Chen §3.9).

f) Regeneration Cycle

g) What cycle time (seconds to minutes) is needed to flush and recycle the ionic liquid separators without halting reactor output? Balance with fluid transport equations (Chen §3.5).
